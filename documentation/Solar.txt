solar energy

Materials
	- Common battery technologies used in today's home PV systems include, the valve regulated lead-acid battery– a modified version of the conventional lead–acid battery, nickel–cadmium and lithium-ion batteries.
	- Other rechargeable batteries used for distributed PV systems include, sodium–sulfur and vanadium redox batteries, two prominent types of a molten salt and a flow battery, respectively
	- Cadmium (Cd) a toxic heavy metal 
		- as semiconductor in CdTe solar cells
		- as buffer layer for CIGS cells (CdS)
	- crystalline silicon modules. Lead in solder material for copper strings of cells
	- Cadmium telluride converted 22.1% of sunlight (experimental)
	- Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (thin-film PV)
	- Polysilicon use exceeds all other polysilicon use
	
Grid Integration :
	- CSP might store excess heat in high-temperature molten salts
		- Solar Two power station store 1.44 TJ in 68m3 tanks for 39h of power at 99% efficiency
	- Solar irradiance is important (africa, australia, mexico, argentina, middle east, india)
	
Costs :
	- PV (25~40 years)
	- Frame
	- Wiring
	- Inverters
	- Labour
	- Land
	- Maintenance (9% of cost, 17% for CSP)
	- Solar Insolation (?)
	- LCOE (Leverized cost of electricity)
		- 1 watt peak solar PV generates 1 to 2 kWh per year
	- These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.
	- payback time (time to produce more energy than it was needed to produce the tech)
		- 2000 : ~8-11 years
		- 2006 : 1.5-3.5 years
		- 2013 : 0.75-3.5
			- avg of 2 years for crystalline silicon
	
Issues :
	- DC power source (PV)
		- Convert to AC with inverters
	- Fluctuating day/night and temperature

World stats :
	- 40% increase per year
	- Total capacity 303 GW (2016)
	- China biggest producer (78 GW)
	- Honduras biggest % of grid use (12.5% solar)
	- Largest manuf = China

artificial photosynthesis
	- convert sunlight, water & CO2 into carbohydrates and oxygen
	- nanotech
	
photovoltaics (PV)
	- (22.1%) Cadmium telluride
	- (34.5%) four-junction module in a prism that extract power from split sun rays for more efficiency
	- (40.8%) concentrated triple-junction inverted metamorphic
	- Largest PV plant america : Ivanpah, 392 MW, Mojave Desert California
	- Largest PV plant world : Longyangxia Dam, 850 MW, Qinghai China
	- China & India leader ?
	- 1931
		- Silver Selenide (selenium cells) 1%
		- Silicon solar cell (4.5~6%)
	- Batteries
	- DC


concentrated solar power
	- Lenses or Mirrors and Tracking
	- Make Steam to power turbine
	- Tech
		- Parabolic trough
			- Most efficient.
			- Ex : 50kW Big Dish, Canberra Australia
		- Compact linear Fresnel reflector
		- Stirling dish
		- Solar power tower
			- Ex : PS10, PS20 solar power plant

hybrid system
	- Combine PV and CSP and/or Diesel, biogas, etc.
