Materials
	- Perovskite solar cells are a very efficient solar energy converter and have excellent optoelectric properties for photovoltaic purposes, but they are expensive and difficult to manufacture.
	- Another newer technology, thin-film PV, are manufactured by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum. The substrate is often glass or stainless-steel, and these semiconducting layers are made of many types of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si).After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics now make up around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.
	- Crystalline silicon photovoltaics : First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an n-type semiconducting surface. To reduce energy losses, an anti-reflective coating is added to the surface, along with electrical contacts. After finishing the cell, cells are connected via electrical circuit according to the specific application and prepared for shipping and installation.

Grid Integration :
	- CSP might store excess heat in high-temperature molten salts
		- Solar Two power station store 1.44 TJ in 68m3 tanks for 39h of power at 99% efficiency
	- Solar irradiance is important (africa, australia, mexico, argentina, middle east, india)
	
Costs :
	- PV (25~40 years)
	- Frame
	- Wiring
	- Inverters
	- Labour
	- Land
	- Maintenance (9% of cost, 17% for CSP)
	- Solar Insolation (?)
	- LCOE (Leverized cost of electricity)
		- 1 watt peak solar PV generates 1 to 2 kWh per year
	- These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: vertical integration of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.
	- payback time (time to produce more energy than it was needed to produce the tech)
		- 2000 : ~8-11 years
		- 2006 : 1.5-3.5 years
		- 2013 : 0.75-3.5
			- avg of 2 years for crystalline silicon
